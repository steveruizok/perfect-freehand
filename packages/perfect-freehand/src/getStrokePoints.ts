/**
 * ## getStrokePoints
 * @description Get an array of points as objects with an adjusted point, pressure, vector, distance, and runningLength.
 * @param points An array of points (as `[x, y, pressure]` or `{x, y, pressure}`). Pressure is optional in both cases.
 * @param options (optional) An object with options.
 * @param options.size	The base size (diameter) of the stroke.
 * @param options.thinning The effect of pressure on the stroke's size.
 * @param options.smoothing	How much to soften the stroke's edges.
 * @param options.easing	An easing function to apply to each point's pressure.
 * @param options.simulatePressure Whether to simulate pressure based on velocity.
 * @param options.start Cap, taper and easing for the start of the line.
 * @param options.end Cap, taper and easing for the end of the line.
 * @param options.last Whether to handle the points as a completed stroke.
